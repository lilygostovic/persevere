    "name": "moderchai",
    "description": "mordechai is a multimedia project created by Charlie Zacks from Atlanta, Georgia, USA. mordechai is mostly concerned with expression between the digital and physical. mordechai's video content utilizes found footage, home videos, unseen YouTube videos, videos dug up from long-abandoned forums, generative artificial intelligence, and expressive editing to elicit emotional responses unique to the interaction between his art and the viewer. His still-image illustrations mostly consist of provocative statements paired with depictions of catastrophe. His art has been displayed at La MaMa Galleria in New York City, as well as various other galleries and art spaces in NYC, Atlanta, and Montréal. He is a student at McGill University, studying religious studies, with a particular interest in post-modern metaphysics (less pretentious than it sounds). He is also a writer and works as an audio engineer."

    "name": "ISABEL YONG",
    "description": "Isabel Yong is a Montreal based artist that has been primarily working with oil paints since 2018. As a third culture kid with a complex and divided family history, her work has explored themes of impermanence, love, identity and the self, reflecting her dynamic external and internal environments. Her recent work has veered more towards themes of love – including queerness, interconnectedness, and tragedy – and navigating emotional distance both with others and within herself. Isabel plans to pursue a career in clinical therapy, with plans to finish her BSc undergraduate and Honors thesis next fall. Although with recent attention she's paid towards her art-making, she also has plans to move back to Europe, potentially exploring a career in fine arts."
