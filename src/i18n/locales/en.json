Our exhibit welcomed 250 attendees who celebrated the work of nine artists, four designers, and three musical acts. Three of nine artists sold exhibited works, reaching our goal of platforming emerging talent. The event provided a platform for creatives and enabled us to raise $3,810 for Face à Face, with 100% of the proceeds going directly to their essential services.",
