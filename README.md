## About Persevere

Persevere is a Montréal-based student initiative founded by McGill students. Their initiative strives to create a platform for local artists while fostering engagement between students and the broader Montréal community. They hold an annual event in support of Face à Face, a local charity offering vital support services to individuals experiencing homelessness. These services encompass housing assistance, mail reception, and active listening sessions to help those without homes and other underserved communities.
